       <h4>Objective: 
Build a model to simulate the match making process of modern society.</h4>

For the simplicity of the model, assume each individual has 3 indices: wealth, appearence, personality.
Each index is in the range of 1-100. <br>
On top of that, each individual weighs those 3 qualitires diffrently, 
e.g. on person may care the appearence much more than the others 2 qualities, 
while this other person may care more about  personality of its counterpart.
As a result, there are another 3 index depicting the expectation ratios of those three qualities
and natrally, these 3 index have a total sum of 100.<br>
For example:
For a male player, a valid vector of indices of him is as following:
(80,50,40,10,30,60)
In which, his appearence socored as 80, wealth as 50, personality as 40
and his expectation of the apearence of his perfect match is 10%, wealth 30% and personality 60%.
10+30+60==100. <br>

To further simplify the model, it is assumed that the information is symmetrical,
meaning those 3 indices of each individual is public record and objectiveï¼Œ
and each individual choose its perfect match based on its own perception ratios.

        In this project, assume there are 100 male and female each.
In the match making process, each individual select its perfect match by evaluate 3 qualities of 
its counterpart as follow: <br>
Suppose a male player's profile is as follow:M(80,50,40,10,30,60)
and a female player: F(50,60,80,40,10,50).<br>
Thus, the attraction level of this man towards the womman is evaluated as:
10*50+30*60+60*80=7100. <br>
 While, the woman towards the man:
40*80+10*50+50*40=5700. <br>
Obviously, the perfect match for each individual is the one with the highest score.
Additionally, if two player possess the same score of attraction, then compare the sum of those 
3 indices: appearence+wealth+personality. <br>
If still the same, then the one with smaller ID wins, IDs are given as the first element of
the profile vector of each player in the input file: male.txt and female.txt <br> <br>

Now that we have specified the rules of finding the perfect match, the whole match making 
process goes as following procedures: <br>
        <ol>
          <li>Start with the male players, specifically, going through each male player, each select his dream girl by applying the rules mentioned above and invite that girl.</li>
          <li>Then the female player who received the most invitations select her best suit.</li>
          <li>At this point, we find a match, remove them from the player pool.</li>
          <li>Lastly, return to step 1 and iterate through this process for the rest of the player until 
the last man match the last woman.</li>
        </ol>
        <br>
        In this project, it is also required that a user could input its own profile, replace a random player of the same sex, and go 
through the process as the main charactor to find its perfect match, then ouput the result.
the ID of the main charactor is suggested to be defined as -1 in order to be selected first in the process. <br>
Hence, a third file, containing the profile vectors of the main charactor, is given and in those
vectors, the first element is the sex of the player 1 for male, 0 for female.
In all, 3 standard input files are given: male.txt, female.txt, player.txt. <br><br>

For testing, 2 results are given: <br>
the first main charactor(the first line in the player.txt) should select the player with profile as follow: <br>
(6,18,82,87,3,10). Please note that the id is ignoed. <br>
the second main charactor(the second line) should select: <br>
(27,74,22,22,58,20).

        Q:Can you explain your implementation? e.g. why do you use priority
        queue rather than other sorting methods? <br>

        A:Please Visit my blog, I have a full explaination of how I developed
        this project and some design decisions. <a href="#"> comming soon</a> <br> <br>


        Q:How do you test your program? <br>
        
        A:For unit tests, I did it in its original project <a
            href="https://github.com/Gontreal/Match-Making-Simulation">here</a>.
        In terms of the functional validation option in this page, it was
        provided by the host of this competition in the specs(my friend in
        China particapated and he give it to me.) to test the program. It's
        a list of 100 player's matching information, and two players' supposed
        match are told(the first and last as mentioned in my VALIDATION
        option) the others are for stress test I guess(to see the performance
        of your program) <br> <br>


        Q:What's the point of your project? <br>

        A: Well, I have to admit that there are too many simplifications and
        abstractions in this project (e.g. how do you give a score on one
        individual's personality?) I think the main point of this project is
        to test the efficiency of the sorting algorithm(a big algorithm test)
        and how do to impletment it to achieve the least
        possible overhead(like the time spent dealing memory access). On top
        of that, the idea of this project might be used to other much simpler matching
        services. The one I can think of is the rank matching service in
        online MOBA games like LOL or Dota2, it could help players their
        desired match based on their own scores on and their expectations.
        Just a thought... In a word, I don't think this project has much
        practical use other than to see how to see algorithmic problem solving
        ability and language skills.  <br> <br>


        Q:How about much larger data set? say, 10000 player pool? <br>

        A: I'm curious too but I don't have that much data yet, I'll move its
        original data into a database first(currently in a txt file) and then
        I'll figure out a way to generate more entries of player information
        randomly and automatically for testing. <br> <br>


        Lastly, if you have other questions, suggestions, report bugs or even critics,
        feel free to contact me by email.
