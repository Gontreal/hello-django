              <h3>A match making simulation</h3>
              <p>This project is the major reason why I made this website. It
              was originally a c++ project that a friend of mine introduced to
              me. Back then, I just finished studying c++ from C++ Premier and
              half way in the study of algorithms and data structures, and
              this was the perfect start project for me to get my hand dirty.
              It involves implementing an efficient sorting algorithm for the
              matching process(I uesed priority queue), and a soid structure
              of classed working together to encapsulate the algorithm and
              to handle this matching process. Detail specs and explainations are in
              the project page and my blog.</p>
              <p> The main featrue of this project is as follows:
              <ul>
                  <li>High perfromance c++ code with the potential to handle
                      large data set and high traffic. </li>
                  <li>Hybrid programming(python and c++) with boost library to
                  make the original program interact with Django yet ensure
                  its level of performace.</li>
                  <li>AJAX protocol to ensure a fluent communication between
                      front end and back end. </li>
              </ul>
